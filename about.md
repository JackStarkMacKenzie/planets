## Descriptions

# First Time Mothers

From the raw data we filtered and extracted first time mothers underneath the age of nineteen. Breaking down this dataset
by datazone gives us a look at the proportion of potentially, financially disadvantaged young mothers and how they are                                                                               
distributed throoughout the geographical area.

# Poor Household EPC Grades

For this dataset we extracted each UPRN's EPC rating from the raw data and arranged it to show the proportion
of households that have an EPC rating of less than C for every datazone. The resulting dataset can aid an
understanding of how each datazone is coping under the pressure of energy prices during this Cost of Living Crisis.

# Total Household Floor Area

From the same raw data set we used for Poor Household EPC Grades, we processed it instead to show the mean
total floor area of households within every datazone. Knowing the proportion of households that have poor
EPC gradings, and then to also know how big the properties are in each datazone, furthers an investigation
into which datazones are struggling to pay for energy given poor epc gradings and smaller/more affordable
housing.
